    <div class="text-about">
        <p>New Zealand (Māori: Aotearoa  is an island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.
        It consists of two main landmasses—the North Island (Te Ika-a-Māui) and the South Island 
        (Te Waipounamu)—and over 700 smaller islands. It is the sixth-largest island country by area, covering 268,021 square 
        kilometres. New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) east of Australia across the Tasman 
        Sea and 1,000 kilometres (600 mi) south of the islands of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. 
        The country's varied topography and sharp mountain peaks, including the Southern Alps,
        owe much to tectonic uplift and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, and its most populous city is Auckland.</p>

        <h4>Auckland is made up of a bustling urban city centre, quirky neighbourhoods, beachside suburbs and 
            gorgeous bush. And the activities are just as diverse.</h4>
    
        <p class="chch">
            <h4>Go on a walk or spend the day at the beach</h4>
You’ll find the best of both worlds in Auckland, with beautiful rainforest, parks and beaches all so close to the city centre. 
The  Waitakere Ranges Regional Park west of the city centre has more than 250 kilometres of walking and hiking tracks through lush native rainforest,
 past cascading waterfalls and along a magnificent coastline. Walk through the region’s largest native forest in the Hunua Ranges or explore the striking 
 landscapes of some of Auckland’s 26 regional parks, such as Duder, Shakespear, Tapapakanga or Awhitu.    

You’re never far from the sea in Auckland. Bring your board to one of the black-sand surf beaches on the wild west coast – Karekare, Piha, Te Henga 
(Bethells), Muriwai and more. Head north to the expansive golden sands and clear waters of Tāwharanui and  Pakiri.  Closer to the city centre, visit 
Mission Bay, Kohimarama or St Heliers, just a 15-minute drive from downtown Auckland. Enjoy a stroll along the promenade, hire a kayak or stand up 
paddleboard, or tuck into fresh fish and chips. 
<h4>Island hopping</h4>

Explore Auckland’s magnificent Hauraki Gulf and its beautiful islands. The jewel of the gulf is Waiheke Island, a haven of vineyards, olive groves, 
beaches and fine dining, just a 40-minute ferry ride from downtown Auckland.

For an exciting day trip, discover the history and sandy coves of Rotoroa Island, explore the open wildlife sanctuary of Tiritiri Matangi Island or 
climb the volcanic cone of Rangitoto Island for incredible views from the summit. If you have a little more time, travel by light plane to Great Barrier 
Island, renowned for its rugged beauty and unspoilt wilderness.  
<h4>Enjoy the food and wine</h4>

Auckland has an impressive variety of restaurants, cafes and bars to suit every taste and budget. In the inner city you’ll find modern dining at Britomart,
 Federal Street and City Works Depot. Enjoy dinner and drinks or a casual bite on Auckland’s beautiful waterfront in the Viaduct Harbour and Wynyard Quarter
  precincts.

Auckland has three main wine growing regions, where superb wine and stunning scenery go hand in hand. Visit Waiheke Island, known as ‘the island of wine’
 for its 30 wineries and vineyards. North of the city discover Matakana’s boutique wineries set amid picturesque coastal countryside. Kumeu in the west is 
 home to Auckland’s oldest established vineyards and is surround by market gardens and organic produce.
